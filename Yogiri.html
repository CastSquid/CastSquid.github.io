<p>Although he may not look like much, Yogiri Takatou is a high schooler on a completely different level of power.<br>
With his Instant Death ability, neither foes nor even the laws of physics in his new world stand a chance against him.
</p>

<h2><strong>A quick look at our fighter's Strengths!</strong></h2>

      <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><strong><center>Yogiri's Core Abilites</center></strong></span>  
      
      <ul>
            <li><strong>Instant Death:</strong> Can end anything with a thought — living beings, objects, concepts, even the laws of reality. Works automatically as defense and ignores all resistance, immortality, and causality.</li> 
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Half-Death:</strong> Can selectively “kill” specific parts (limbs, senses, organs) without killing the whole target.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Conceptual Erasure:</strong> Can erase abstract phenomena like gravity, time, space, memories, or abilities themselves.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Atemporal & Remote Death:</strong> Can kill through recordings, across dimensions, or outside normal time and space.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Immunity & Invulnerability Negation:</strong> Even indestructible armors, gods, or untouchable entities fall to his ability.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Automatic Defense:</strong> Instantly retaliates against any threat — even those faster than light or beyond time.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Threat Detection:</strong> Senses hostility, danger, and power sources across dimensions, and preemptively kills them.</li>
            &nbsp;
        </ul>      
   </li>

      <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><strong><center> Higher Phases / True Form </center></strong></span>

      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Gate System:</strong> Restrains his power in “phases” to avoid destroying the world; higher gates allow full conceptual erasure.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>:Abstract Existence:</strong> His human self is just a vessel — his true form is the embodiment of The End of All Things, a being beyond fate, time, gods, and multiverses.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Ultimate Ensemble Control:</strong> Defines existence itself; reality persists only because his will allows it.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Endless Void:</strong> Victims of his Instant Death are erased into a void where even omnipotence cannot function.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Homeostasis:</strong> His true form ensures nothing interferes with his human life, deleting threats automatically.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li><strong>Immortality Cycle:</strong> Reborn endlessly after death.</li>
            &nbsp;
      </ul>
              
      <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><strong><center>Other Skills</center></strong></span>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Swordsmanship:</strong> Competent with a blade, though vastly overshadowed by his hax abilities.</li>
          &nbsp;
          <li><strong>Disease Immunity:</strong> Germs and viruses die near him automatically.</li>
          &nbsp;
          <li><strong>Memory & Concept Killing:</strong> Can erase memories or even the idea of something existing.</li>
      </ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3 style="font-size: 24px;"><Strong><em><center>~Now on to the Verdict~</center></strong></em></h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Although Rimuru stands as one of the most broken beings in his verse with reality erasure, law domination, infinite regeneration, and Raphael’s near-omniscience,<br>
Yogiri is on an entirely different level. His Instant Death ability ignores all defenses, immortality, and even causality itself, automatically activating against any threat.<br>
No matter how many times Rimuru resurrects or adapts, Yogiri simply ends his existence, making him the inevitable victor in this matchup.
